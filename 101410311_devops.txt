COMP 3104: About DevOps:
Instructor: Pritesh Patel

Welcome to the course! In this course, we will explore the DevOps best practices along with some tools and technologies required to implement DevOps. By the end of the course, you will be prepared to explore job opportunities as a DevOps engineer. You will learn the procedures, protocols, and best practices that a DevOps engineer brings to a workplace environment to increase productivity. Analyze and evaluate various developer operation implementations that are available and implement hands-on work using the industry-standard toolkit. Create a solution to complex business problems by adhering to the core responsibilities of DevOps.

We have an exciting journey ahead of us exploring the world of DevOps. DevOps is a crucial approach that brings together development and operations teams to enhance collaboration and productivity throughout the software development lifecycle.

Throughout the course, I'm sure we'll cover a variety of key topics, including:

DevOps Principles: Understanding the fundamental principles that guide DevOps practices, such as collaboration, automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.

Tools and Technologies: Exploring the various tools and technologies that facilitate DevOps practices, including version control systems, continuous integration tools, containerization (e.g., Docker), orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), and configuration management tools.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Implementing and understanding the CI/CD pipeline to automate the process of testing and deploying code changes.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Learning the concept of treating infrastructure as code, allowing for the automated provisioning and management of infrastructure.

Monitoring and Logging: Implementing effective monitoring and logging practices to ensure the health and performance of applications and infrastructure.

Collaboration and Communication: Emphasizing the importance of collaboration and communication between development and operations teams for seamless integration and delivery.

Security in DevOps: Integrating security practices into the DevOps pipeline to ensure the safety of applications and data.

Case Studies and Hands-On Projects: Applying theoretical knowledge through hands-on projects and case studies to reinforce learning and develop practical skills.
