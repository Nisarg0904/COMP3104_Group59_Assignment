My Fav place to study.

Initially, GBC focused on vocational training and practical skills in fields like nursing, construction, and the culinary arts. Over time, it expanded its programs to include business, design, health sciences, and technology, evolving into one of the most diverse and comprehensive colleges in Canada.

GBC was founded as part of Ontario’s initiative to create a system of community colleges to provide education in trades, technology, and applied arts. The goal was to meet the growing demand for skilled labor in post-World War II Canada.
