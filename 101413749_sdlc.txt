DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the software development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software at a faster pace. It promotes collaboration between development and operations teams to automate processes, ensure continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), and improve communication across the entire lifecycle of a productâ€”from planning to coding, building, testing, and deploying. DevOps emphasizes automation, monitoring, and feedback loops to improve system efficiency, reliability, and scalability.
