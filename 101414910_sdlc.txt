What are the benefits of DevOps-COMP3014?

DevOps is more than just a set of practices; it's a mindset that breaks down the traditional barriers between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. In essence, DevOps aims to unify software development and IT operations, enabling faster, more reliable, and efficient software delivery.

It's about automating and streamlining every phase of the software lifecycle: development, testing, deployment, and monitoring. With DevOps, the focus is on continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), where code changes are integrated regularly, tested, and deployed to production without human intervention.
